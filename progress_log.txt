Objective: Complete rebranding from "Servet" to "Schola Way"
Progress Summary:
- ✅ Updated package.json name from "servet-web" to "schola-way"
- ✅ Updated HTML title and meta description to "Schola Way - Your Educational Journey Partner"
- ✅ Updated PWA manifest with new branding (short_name and name)
- ✅ Updated Header component logo from "TR → USA Education" to "Schola Way"
- ✅ Updated Footer component branding and email to "info@scholaway.com"
- ✅ Updated Home page content to be more general educational focus (removed Turkey/USA specific messaging)
- ✅ Updated Contact page content and email references
- ✅ Updated Blog page content to be internationally focused
- ⚠️ Main folder rename from "Servet" to "Schola-Way" needs manual completion due to security restrictions
- ⚠️ Package-lock.json may contain references to old name (needs verification)

Key Decisions:
- Changed brand positioning from Turkey-to-USA specific to general educational journey assistance
- Maintained existing UI/UX design while updating content and branding
- Updated email domain to scholaway.com for consistency

Next Steps:
1. User needs to manually rename main folder from "Servet" to "Schola-Way"
2. Verify and update any remaining "servet" references in package-lock.json if needed
3. Test all functionality after folder rename
4. Consider updating any hardcoded paths that might reference the old folder name
